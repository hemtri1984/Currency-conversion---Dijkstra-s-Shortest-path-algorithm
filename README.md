# Currency-conversion---Dijkstra-s-Shortest-path-algorithm
This is a short project showing currency conversion of different countries into specific currency for financial calculation of company sales. It contains the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm approach to find the minimum number of iterations to convert any currency and show accumulated sales of each and every product for near to accurate financial calculations.
